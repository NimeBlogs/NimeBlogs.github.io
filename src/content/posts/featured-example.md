# Featured Article Example

This is an example of a featured article that will be displayed in the featured posts carousel on the homepage. Articles can be featured in two ways:

1. By adding the `Featured` tag to the post's tags array
2. By setting `featured: true` in the post's frontmatter

## Why Feature Articles?

Featuring articles is a great way to:

- Highlight your best or most important content
- Showcase new articles that you want to draw attention to
- Provide quick access to key information for your readers

## How to Feature Your Articles

To feature an article, simply add either:

- `tags: ["Featured", ...]` to the post frontmatter, or
- `featured: true` to the post frontmatter

The carousel will automatically pick up these articles and display them in order of publication date (newest first).

## Customization Options

The featured posts carousel can be customized by modifying the `FeaturedPostsCarousel.astro` component. You can change:

- The number of posts displayed at once
- The styling of the carousel
- The transition effects
- The responsive behavior for different screen sizes

Enjoy showcasing your best content!
